Imports

In Python you don't have to write every function yourself. You can use functions that exist in modules.
You can think of a module as a set of functions.

For example:
    import math
    x = math.sin(1)
    y = math.cos(1)

Here you don't write the functions sin() and cos() yourself, you load them from the math module using the import keyword.

Another example:
    import os
    os.mkdir('new directory')

Here you call the function mkdir() which creates a new directory. The function exists in the module os which you load
using import.

You can install modules yourself using the pip package manager, the command for that:
    pip install module

or the command:
    pip3 install module
