Play around with variables.  A variable is data in the computers memory.

Try the program below:
    hero = "spiderman"
    strength = 5
    price = 1.5
    print(hero)
Now create your own variables and output them to the screen. For fun you can try some mathematical operators like +, -, *, /.

    strength = strength + 1
    print(strength)
You can show the type of data, try that for all your variables

    print(type(hero))
Here we call the function type() and the output of that function is given to the print() function.
