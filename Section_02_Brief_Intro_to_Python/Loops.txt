A loop repeats code. There are two kinds of loops in Python, for and while loops.


for loops

A for loop repeats code until the condition is met.
    for i in range(10):
        print(i)

This repeats the call the print() function ten times. Variable i is the iterator variable, this counts every round of
the loop. Your for loop can have multiple lines of code to repeat.

You can use it on lists too:

    websites = ["udemy.com", "google.com", "wikipedia.org"]
    for site in websites:
         print(site)

while loops

If you don't know how long something is gonna take, you need a while loop.

Some examples:
    while playing_game:
       do_game_stuff()

    while raining:
       umbrella()

Without a stopping condition, while loops would go on forever. While loops must have a stopping condition:
    while playing_game:
        do_game_stuff()
        if bored:
           break

    while raining:
       umbrella()
       if sunshine:
           break

A numeric example:
    i = 1
    while i < 10
        print(i)

        # stopping condition
        if i == 5:
            break
