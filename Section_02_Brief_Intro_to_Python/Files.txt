Files

You can use Python to read and write files. Some code examples

Read file:
    f = open("file_name", "r")
    file_text = f.read()
    print(file_text)

Append to existing file:
    f = open("your_file.txt", "a")
    f.write("This line is added")
    f.close()

Create and write file:
    f = open("your_file.txt", "w")
    f.write("file created, with this contents")
    f.close()
