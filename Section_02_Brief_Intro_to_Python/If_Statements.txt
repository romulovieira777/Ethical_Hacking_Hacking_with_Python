Programs make decisions all the time. A self driving car needs to decide if to accelerate or to break. A robot vacuum
cleaner needs to decide if to drive forward or break and so on.

How can programs make decisions?

Using if statements.

For example:
    if job:
       work()
    else:
      search_job()

Python is very strict with indention, always use four spaces. And note the colon : character

Here if  indicates the start of the decision. Python always decides based on a variable or condition.

The colon : indicates the end of the if statement

Every indented line is part of the code block (what to do if it's true/false)

else indicates the negative situation

Another example:
    if age < 18:
        print("cannot vote")
    else:
        print("you can vote")
