This is not a programming course, however I will briefly introduce Python.

If you already know the Python programming language, skip this section.


You can run Python by  saving a file as my_program.py with the code and then typing the command

python my_program.py

or the command

python3 my_program.py

If Python is not installed, head over to python.org
