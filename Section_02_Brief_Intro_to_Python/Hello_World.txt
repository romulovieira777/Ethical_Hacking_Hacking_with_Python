Hello world

Create a program that outputs the text "hello world". The code for that is:
    print("Hello World")

Run the program and try to output different things, like multiple lines (use \n), tabs (use \t).

The parenthesis () indicate that a function is called, the print function. The text "Hello World" is a parameter to the function.
Text is always between quotes "" , in programming we call text strings.

So "Hello World" is a string.
